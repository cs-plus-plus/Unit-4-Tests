# Unit 4 Java Programming Project

This project is designed for Mr. Hare's APCS-A, focusing on Unit 4 concepts such as loops, iteration, and nested loops. The project includes a set of methods that students need to implement, along with unit tests to verify their functionality.

## Project Structure

- **`Unit4.java`**: Contains method headers and task descriptions. Students are required to implement the method bodies.
- **`Unit4Test.java`**: JUnit test cases for each method in `Unit4.java`. These tests validate the correctness of the implemented methods.
- **`pom.xml`**: Maven configuration file that manages dependencies and plugins required to build and run the project.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 (or compatible version)
- Maven 3.x

## Getting Started

### Accept the Project

Use the link found in Google Classroom to accept in GitHub Classroom.

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using GitHub Desktop.

### Run Tests

Run the JUnit tests to verify your implementations.

## Method Descriptions

Students need to implement the following methods in `Unit4.java`:

1. **`sumNumbers(int n)`**: Sums numbers from 1 to n using iteration.
2. **`repeatString(String str, int n)`**: Repeats a given string n times.
3. **`findFactorial(int n)`**: Finds the factorial of a given number using a loop.
4. **`countVowels(String str)`**: Counts the number of vowels in a given string.
5. **`isPalindrome(String str)`**: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
6. **`printAsteriskPatterns(int n)`**: Prints different patterns of asterisks using nested loops.
7. **`multiplicationTable(int n)`**: Prints a multiplication table up to n x n using nested loops.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting to change the loop variable, resulting in infinite loops.
- Incorrect loop conditions that cause out-of-bounds errors or skip necessary iterations.
- Using return statements inside loops incorrectly, leading to premature exits from the loop.
- Misunderstanding the difference between `for` and `while` loops, especially regarding initialization and update steps.
